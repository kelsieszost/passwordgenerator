# Password Generator

## Your Task

For this project I used the skills i learned in class to create a password generator. The generator includes options for including upper,lower,numeric and special characters to create a strong password. I am still struggling with learning the syntax of JS. I am hoping to contribute to this project further once I have gained a better understanding.
